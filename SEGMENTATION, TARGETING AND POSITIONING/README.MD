##  Business Context
- **Firm**: Power BA – boutique investment consultancy serving **individual** and **institutional** clients.  
- **Challenge**: Post-pandemic shifts in investor psychology, digital adoption, and competitive pressures.  
- **Strategic Questions**:  
  1. Should Power BA focus on **retention, reactivation, or new acquisition**?  
  2. Should it prioritize **individual vs. institutional investors**?  
  3. Should it **expand beyond the Australasian market**?

- Recommend a **targeting strategy** using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) principles.

##  Methodology

###  Needs-Based Segmentation
- **Approach**: Hybrid, needs-based segmentation → captures investor motivations, preferences, and decision styles.  
- **Primary Data**: Client surveys, advisory interviews (risk appetite, digital engagement, ESG interest).  
- **Secondary Data**: Demographics, transaction history, portfolio composition, digital engagement scores.  
- **Techniques**: Clustering (K-means, hierarchical, latent class), predictive analytics, churn & lifetime value models.  
- **Dynamic Segmentation**: Machine learning enables real-time updates and evolving customer insights.  

###  Segmentation Variables
- **Basis Variables** (why they invest): risk tolerance, wealth goals (capital appreciation vs. preservation), ESG interest, advisory preferences.  
- **Descriptor Variables** (who they are): investor type (individual/institutional), age, asset size, transaction frequency, digital usage, dormancy status.  

###  CLV-Driven Targeting
- Transition to **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** as the key targeting metric.  
- **Individuals**:  
  - High-value clients → advanced advisory services, proactive engagement.  
  - Younger clients → gamification + mobile-first nudges for education & engagement.  
  - Dormant clients → reactivation campaigns via behavioral triggers.  
- **Institutions**:  
  - Focus on multi-asset diversification and ESG-driven portfolios.  
  - Provide custom consulting, advanced reporting, and international advisory support.

##  Key Findings
- **Needs-based segmentation** is superior to static choice-based approaches → captures *why* investors behave the way they do.  
- Combining **basis + descriptor variables** ensures robust profiling.  
- **CLV-led targeting** aligns resources with the most profitable client relationships for sustainable growth.

##  Strategic Implications
- Empowers Power BA to **retain, reactivate, and acquire** investors strategically.  
- Supports both **individual and institutional clients** with tailored solutions.  
- Positions Power BA for **long-term growth** and potential global expansion.
